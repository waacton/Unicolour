         * extra guff for navigating to SPA routes while nested inside of 'github pages' deployment
         * e.g. site.com/colour-picker/      --> github serves /colour-picker/index.html
         *      site.com/colour-picker/paint --> github tries to serve /colour-picker/paint ... but doesn't exist so 404 ... need it to actually serve /colour-picker/index.html
         * 1. site.com/colour-picker/paint triggers github's 404.html
         * 2. 404.html has a script to redirect to site.com/colour-picker/?page=paint
         * 3. site.com/colour-picker/ is served with query parameter ?page=paint
         * 4. blazor app is rendered, and if query parameter is detected it will navigate the SPA to that page
